Diverse character of developers on the team

The projects that our company gets engaged with usually require 1-3 developers. Needless to say, any development team includes people with different levels of expertise. That’s why there are respective job titles — junior, middle and senior iOS / Android developer. It doesn’t mean to say that the code written by a junior developer is necessarily of a worse quality than that of a senior IT specialist.
