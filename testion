Diverse character of developers on the team

The projects that our company gets engaged with usually require 1-3 developers. Needless to say, any development team includes people with different levels of expertise. That’s why there are respective job titles — junior, middle and senior iOS / Android developer. It doesn’t mean to say that the code written by a junior developer is necessarily of a worse quality than that of a senior IT specialist.

However, people are different. Especially creative mobile app developers, this sphere of technology is so lucky to employ within its ranks. Programmers tend to write software differently. Therefore their pieces of writing can sometimes create issues when other developers try to figure them out.
