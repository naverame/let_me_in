What moves origin/HEAD "organically"?

    git clone sets it once to the spot where HEAD is on origin
        it serves as the default branch to checkout after cloning with git clone

What sets origin/HEAD?

    git clone fetches and sets it
    it would make sense if git fetch updates it like any other reference, but it doesn’t
    git remote set-head origin -a fetches and sets it
        useful to update the local knowledge of what remote considers the “default branch”
