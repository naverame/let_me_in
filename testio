What moves origin/HEAD "organically"?

    git clone sets it once to the spot where HEAD is on origin
        it serves as the default branch to checkout after cloning with git clone

What does HEAD on origin represent?

    on bare repositories (often repositories “on servers”) it serves as a marker for the default branch, because git clone uses it in such a way
    on non-bare repositories (local or remote), it reflects the repository’s current checkout
